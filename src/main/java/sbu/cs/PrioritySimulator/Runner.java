     * Simulate a priority system between Black, white, and blue threads.
     * Given a number of each thread type, your program must first execute every Black thread, then
     execute every Blue thread, and finally execute every white thread. (Black > Blue > White)
     * Complete each thread type class by adding the specified code in the respective run() methods.

     * The order of execution only matters when comparing two different thread types. This means two
     black threads are not prioritised over each other (can swap their execution order) but between a
     Black thread and a Blue thread, the Black thread must fully execute before the Blue thread starts.

     * You are NOT ALLOWED to use the Thread.Sleep() method to solve this problem, as it does not
     guarantee the desired thread execution order.
     * You can utilize other classes and methods available in the java.util.concurrent package. It is
     recommended that you use the "CountDownLatch" class to solve the problem.

     * You are allowed to change the existing code in any of the given classes or add your own new code
     to any of them.
     * Your code must pass all of the test cases provided in the test folder.

     * @param blackCount    number of black threads
     * @param blueCount     number of blue threads
     * @param whiteCount    number of white threads
